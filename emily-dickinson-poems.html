           <p>I had no time to Hate —<br>Because<br>The Grave would hinder Me —<br>And Life was not so<br>Ample I<br>Could
              finish — Enmity —<br><br>Nor had I time to Love —<br>But since<br>Some Industry must be —<br>The little Toil of
              Love —<br>I thought<br>Be large enough for Me —

           <p>The Butterfly upon the Sky,<br>That doesn't know its Name<br>And hasn't any tax to pay<br>And hasn't any Home<br>Is just as high as you and I,<br>And higher, I believe,<br>So soar away and never sigh<br>And that's the way

           <p>Much madness is divinest sense<br>To a discerning eye;<br>Much sense the starkest madness.<br>'Tis the
              majority<br>In this, as all, prevails.<br>Assent, and you are sane;<br>Demur, — you're straightaway dangerous,<

           <p>I felt a Cleaving in my Mind —<br>As if my Brain had split —<br>I tried to match it — Seam by Seam —<br>But
              could not make them fit.<br><br>The thought behind, I strove to join<br>Unto the thought before —<br>But
             Sequence ravelled out of Sound<br>Like Balls — upon a Floor.</p>

           <p>A not admitting of the wound<br>Until it grew so wide<br>That all my Life had entered it<br>And there were
              troughs beside —<br><br>A closing of the simple lid that opened to the sun<br>Until the tender Carpenter<br>
              Perpetual nail it down —</p>
