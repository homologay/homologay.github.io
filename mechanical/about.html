    <p>Goblin mechanical was created in 2024 by me, Maxine.
    I felt that I could work better by going mobile,
    instead of working for nonprofits or established shops. My business aims to 
    fill several gaps I see in the mechanical scene: <br>
    -Attentive to the ebike and escooter explosion. Most shops that fix
    ebikes and escooters only work on the models they sell. Although cheap
    ebikes and escooters are often built-to-fail, there are many fixes
    that can be done with a multimeter, soldering iron, and standard bicycle 
    components. I recognize the importance of these devices as they fill gaps
    in the transportation system, and even though they can be frustrating or 
    impossible to fix, I push back against acoustic bicycle elitism.<br>
    -Working to improve the horrible market for mobility device repair.
    Although most mobility devices can be fixed with standard hand tools
    and affordable spare parts, there are many barriers people face
    trying to get mobility devices repaired. Often, people are 
    not able to get insurance to cover the full cost, or can't make
    it to a brick-and-mortar shop. <br>
    -Working against the homophobia, misogyny, and transmisogyny
    that plagues mechanical shops. While there are some 
    access nights at community bike shops that work towards this, I 
    am not aware of any mobile bicycle mechanics that make it a focus. In all
    my interactions with my customers I make consent and respect a priority.<br>
    -Making education a priority. I have experience teaching cycling safety
    and bicycle mechanics to youth and adults with HUB Cycling. I
    am able to offer workshops on a number of topics, and I am happy
    to explain my process while I am working. I believe in sharing mechanical
    knowledge instead of gatekeeping it.
