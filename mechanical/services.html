    <p>Mobile mechanic services:<br>
    I fix: bicycles, ebikes, escooters, and mobility devices (wheelchairs, 
    walkers, canes, electric mobility scooters). I fix most bicycles, but very high-end ones
    are not my focus as they often have incompatible parts and need special tools. <br>

     and $45 for North Van, West Van, Coquitlam, PoMo,
     PoCo, Surrey, Langley, and Delta. <br>

    Advanced tune: tune, deep clean, and bearing service (3.5hr)

      educational needs and we can work something out.</p>
