    <p>Do you offer free consultations?</p>
    <p>I offer free 30-minute Zoom consultations to decide if my tutoring services are the right fit for your needs.</p>
    <p>Do you have a late fee / cancellation fee?</p>
    <p>Nope! Sometimes the unexpected happens, I understand. I only charge for hours of actual tutoring. That said, please make an effort to show up on time. I can not always extend sessions, and I may refuse services to students who abuse the late policy.</p>
    <p>What courses do you tutor?</p>
    <p>I can tutor many courses, please ask me! Most commonly I tutor calculus, linear algebra, probability, and mathematical proof. I can also tutor english, linux, and basic programming / computer science.</p>
    <p>Do you tutor kids?</p>
    <p>Sometimes! I have years of experience working with youth, and I have no criminal record. I aim my marketing towards college students, but I'm happy to tutor kids and I've done so in the past! That said, I don't really like tutoring kids if their parents made them do tutoring. If your kid wants to learn more about math, I can help!</p>
    <p>Do you give a guarantee to pass?</p>
    <p>No. I can give you confidence for your exams, I can tell you what parts of the notes are important, I can explain concepts with metaphors and pictures. I can help you develop studying methods that work for you. But, the end result is up to you! And, if you've failed a course, don't be hard on yourself. I can guarantee that you're smart and capable, just missing foundations or needing some more practice.</p> 
    <p>Did you make this website?</p>
