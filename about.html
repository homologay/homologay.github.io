    <p>Goblin mechanical was created in 2025 by me, Maxine. My aim is to provide an affordable
    mobile repair service for mobility devices. Many people also use bicycles, ebikes, and escooters as
    mobility devices, or as tools for commuting faster.</p>
   <p>I have professional experience fixing biycles, ebikes, and a wide variety of mechanical devices. I'm primarily experienced
  with stuff that is old, rusty, poorly-maintained, or cheaply manufactured. I am a generalist -
    I will work on many things, but I am not an expert on any one product.</p> 
    <p>My business is especially for people who feel alienated from mechanic shops. When interacting with
    customers, I assume nothing about their mechanical knowledge, and I avoid technical jargon when possible. I am happy to explain
    my process as I work, or to just let you know when I'm finished working. </p>
